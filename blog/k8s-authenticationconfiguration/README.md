Test How to setup AuthenticationConfiguration

# CORRECT JWT

```json
{
  "iss": "https://example.com",   // must match the issuer.url
  "aud": ["my-app"],              // at least one of the entries in issuer.audiences must match the "aud" claim in presented JWTs.
  "exp": 1234567890,              // token expiration as Unix time (the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC)
  "<username-claim>": "user"      // this is the username claim configured in the claimMappings.username.claim or claimMappings.username.expression
}
```

# Create role 
```sh
kubectl apply -f ./clusterrolebinding.yaml
```
